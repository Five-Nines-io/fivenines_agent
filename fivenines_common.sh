#
# ROTATION IS A BREAKING CHANGE. Every installed agent carries the key below
# verbatim, so a release signed with a different key is REJECTED by every
# host until it picks up a new installer. To rotate: publish the installer
# carrying the new key first, let the fleet take it, and only then switch
# RELEASE_SIGNING_KEY. Emptying this block is the escape hatch - it drops
# back to checksum-only verification, loudly, rather than failing closed.

# The key must be identical here and in all four install scripts;
# ci/build-scripts.sh --check fails if they drift, because a key pasted into
# three scripts out of four leaves the fourth verifying nothing. CI also
# refuses to sign a release whose key does not match this block.
