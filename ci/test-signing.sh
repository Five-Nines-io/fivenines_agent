# Release-signature verification tests.
#
# Generates a throwaway ECDSA P-256 keypair, signs a manifest with it, and
# drives the real verify_sums_signature from fivenines_common.sh against it.
# The embedded release key is a hard constant in the install scripts with no
# override hook - deliberately - so the test substitutes the trust anchor by
# redefining release_signing_pubkey after sourcing, rather than by adding an
# env var that would weaken the shipped scripts.
#
# Usage: sh ci/test-signing.sh
