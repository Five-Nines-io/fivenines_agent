# Fivenines Agent User-Level Update Script
# Updates an existing user-level installation
#
# Usage: bash fivenines_update_user.sh
#
# Environment variables:
#   FIVENINES_AGENT_URL    - Custom download URL for the agent tarball (e.g., pre-release builds).
#                            Unverified unless FIVENINES_AGENT_SHA256 is also set.
#   FIVENINES_AGENT_SHA256 - Expected SHA-256 of the tarball. Overrides the published
#                            SHA256SUMS; the only way to verify a custom URL.
#   FIVENINES_SKIP_VERIFY  - Set to 1 to install WITHOUT verifying the tarball. Unsupported.
#   FIVENINES_ALLOW_UNSIGNED - Set to 1 to install on a host with no openssl, with
#                            checksum-only verification. Without it, a missing openssl
#                            aborts the install (the signature cannot be checked).
#   FIVENINES_REQUIRE_SIGNATURE - Set to 1 to abort even when this installer embeds no
#                            public key at all (the key-rotation escape hatch). A
#                            signature that cannot be checked is already fatal.
#   FIVENINES_INSTALL_DIR  - Custom install directory (default: ~/.local/fivenines)
#   FIVENINES_CONFIG_DIR   - Custom config directory (default: ~/.config/fivenines_agent)
#
# Example with custom build:
#   FIVENINES_AGENT_URL="https://github.com/Five-Nines-io/fivenines_agent/releases/download/feature-branch-abc1234/fivenines-agent-linux-amd64.tar.gz" bash fivenines_update_user.sh

# Public key the release signature is checked against. ECDSA P-256 with

#
# The matching PRIVATE key lives only in the RELEASE_SIGNING_KEY repository
# secret - never in the release bucket - which is what makes this worth
# anything: a mirror that rewrites SHA256SUMS cannot re-sign it.
#
# ROTATION IS A BREAKING CHANGE. Every installed agent carries the key below
# verbatim, so a release signed with a different key is REJECTED by every
# host until it picks up a new installer. To rotate: publish the installer
# carrying the new key first, let the fleet take it, and only then switch
# RELEASE_SIGNING_KEY. Emptying this block is the escape hatch - it drops
# back to checksum-only verification, loudly, rather than failing closed.

#   openssl ec -in fivenines-release.key -pubout
#
# The key must be identical here and in all four install scripts;
# ci/build-scripts.sh --check fails if they drift, because a key pasted into
# three scripts out of four leaves the fourth verifying nothing. CI also
# refuses to sign a release whose key does not match this block.
