# Fivenines Agent Setup Script
# Works on standard Linux systems (systemd), OpenRC (Alpine), and UNRAID
#
# Environment variables:
#   FIVENINES_AGENT_URL    - Custom download URL for the agent tarball (e.g., pre-release
#                            builds). Unverified unless FIVENINES_AGENT_SHA256 is also set.
#   FIVENINES_AGENT_SHA256 - Expected SHA-256 of the tarball. Overrides the published
#                            SHA256SUMS; the only way to verify a custom URL.
#   FIVENINES_SKIP_VERIFY  - Set to 1 to install WITHOUT verifying the tarball. Unsupported.
#   FIVENINES_ALLOW_UNSIGNED - Set to 1 to install on a host with no openssl, with
#                            checksum-only verification. Without it, a missing openssl
#                            aborts the install (the signature cannot be checked).
#   FIVENINES_REQUIRE_SIGNATURE - Set to 1 to abort even when this installer embeds no
#                            public key at all (the key-rotation escape hatch). A
#                            signature that cannot be checked is already fatal.
#
# Example with custom build:
#   FIVENINES_AGENT_URL="https://github.com/Five-Nines-io/fivenines_agent/releases/download/feature-branch-abc1234/fivenines-agent-linux-amd64.tar.gz" bash fivenines_setup.sh YOUR_TOKEN

# Mirror URLs (R2 is IPv6-compatible, GitHub is fallback). Both serve
# published release assets, which the signed SHA256SUMS covers. The raw
# main-branch URL that used to serve the service unit, the OpenRC script and
# the UNRAID boot script is deliberately gone: nothing signs a moving branch,
# so those files could never be verified while they came from there (#154).

#
# ROTATION IS A BREAKING CHANGE. Every installed agent carries the key below
# verbatim, so a release signed with a different key is REJECTED by every
# host until it picks up a new installer. To rotate: publish the installer
# carrying the new key first, let the fleet take it, and only then switch
# RELEASE_SIGNING_KEY. Emptying this block is the escape hatch - it drops
# back to checksum-only verification, loudly, rather than failing closed.

# ci/build-scripts.sh --check fails if they drift, because a key pasted into
# three scripts out of four leaves the fourth verifying nothing. CI also
# refuses to sign a release whose key does not match this block.
